# Cerebellar Atlases
The cerebellar atlases are a collection of anatomical and functional atlases of the human cerebellum, both of parcellations and continuous maps. The collection is maintained as a [Github repository](https://github.com/diedrichsenlab/cerebellar_atlases).

For every maps, we provide some the following files:
* ..._space-MNI.nii: volume file aligned to FNIRT MNI space
* ..._space-SUIT.nii: volume file aligned to SUIT space
* ....tsv: Color and label lookup table for parcellations
* ....gii: Data projected to surface-based representation of the cerebellum (Diedrichsen & Zotow, 2015).

The atlases are organized by the first author / year of the main paper

The maps can also be viewed online using our [cerebellar atlas viewer](https://www.diedrichsenlab.org/imaging/AtlasViewer).
