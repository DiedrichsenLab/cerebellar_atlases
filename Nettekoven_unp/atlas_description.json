  "LongDesc": "Alpha version of functional parcellation into 34 symmetric regions. The map is based on the probabilistic integration of 4 datasets (King et al., 2019; Nakai & Nishimoto, 2010; Individual Brain Charting project, Pinho et al., 2021; and an unpublished high-resolution version of the MDTB). The color scheme reflects the functional similarity of different regions. The map has not been published or peer reviewed. It is a preliminary version for illustrative purposes only, and is subject to change. Do not use or cite without permission."
